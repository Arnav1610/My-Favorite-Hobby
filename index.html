    <p id="c"> I like tennis for many reasons. The first reason I like tennis is because it is good exersise. Running around is always fun! I also like to hit the ball around. It is great to feel the raquet hitting the ball. One more reason I like to play tennis is because it is fun to play matches against other players. Weather you win or lose, it is still a good game!</p>
